# GPIO Ports
Vcc was set to he 3.3 v.
Ground was set to 0 v.

Pin A: GPIO17, Pin# 11, GPIO_GEN0
Pin B: GPIO18, Pin# 12, GPIO_GEN1

# Hardware
2x NPN transistor 2N4401
1x small breadboard
2x 4 k ohm resistors
2x 56 k ohm resistors

# Setup
Setup NPN transitors with 

# Current Test
Below is table of current measured with a ammeter. Units
are reported in mA.

Pin | GPIO Current | Total Current |
----|--------------|--------------|
Pin A | 0.54 | 5.95 |
Pin B | 0.51 | 5.11 |
----|--------------|--------------|

Both pins on high (3.3 V) gave a total current of 11.06 mA.

This is low current draw and is probably low enough for both the GPIO and LED safety.
I don't have a datasheet for the LEDs but they're probably safe below 20 mA.
Apparently the raspberry pi GPIO pins can handle 50 mA max, so we're safe with a
0.54 mA draw on the base of the transistor.

# Imports and Installs
sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio
pip3 install RPi.GPIO
pip3 install "picamera[array]"

I used a bunch of tutorials, online documentation, etc. for developing the code.

# Setup 
```bash
mv pitracker.sh /etc/init.d
cd /etc/init.d
chmod 0755  pitracker.sh
sudo chkconfig --add pitracker.sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Test it out!
sudo service pitracker.sh start
```
